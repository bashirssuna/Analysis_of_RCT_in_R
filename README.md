Topic: Effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing infection after uncomplicated vaginal birth at St. Francis Nsambya Hospital. A non-inferiority randomized clinical trail

Abstract

Introduction: Infections occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium are associated with considerable maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality affecting an estimated 5 to 7% of women during this time. In Uganda, puerperal sepsis is the commonest cause of maternal mortality at a prevalence of 30.9%. Antibiotics are often used to prevent infection in women who have undergone cesarean delivery, but their use after uncomplicated vaginal birth is less clear. 
General objective: To determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing infection after uncomplicated vaginal birth at St. Francis Nsambya Hospital
Methods: This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be recruited from obstetric units at a large teaching hospital. Eligible women will be those who are 18 years of age or older and who have had an uncomplicated vaginal birth. Women will be randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics or a placebo within six hours of giving birth. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of infection within 3 days of giving birth. Infection will be diagnosed based on clinical criteria, including the presence of fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and/or uterine tenderness. Secondary outcome measures will include adverse effects associated with the use of antibiotics (e.g., allergic reactions, diarrhea, nausea) and factors that may predict the likelihood of infection after uncomplicated vaginal birth.  

Specific objective
1.	To determine the rate of infection after uncomplicated vaginal birth in women who receive antibiotics compared to those who do not at St. Francis Nsambya Hospital
2.	To assess for any potential adverse effects associated with the use of antibiotics after uncomplicated vaginal birth at St. Francis Nsambya Hospital
3.	To determine the factors that may predict the likelihood of infection after uncomplicated vaginal birth and impact the effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing infection at St. Francis Nsambya Hospital
